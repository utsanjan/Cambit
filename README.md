  Measure your heartbeat effortlessly<br>using your phone camera & flashlight
</p>

## 📖 Overview
Cambit leverages the principles of Photoplethysmography (PPG) to monitor your heartbeat. Simply use your phone's camera and flashlight to capture your heart rate.

## 🌟 Features
- **Heartbeat Detection:** Measure your pulse with your phone's camera and flash.
- **User-Friendly:** Easy-to-use interface for quick results.
- **Accurate Monitoring:** Reliable readings based on PPG principles.

## 🛠️ How It Works
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive method to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. A pulse oximeter illuminates the skin and measures changes in light absorption to monitor blood perfusion.

- **Light Absorption:** The light from an LED illuminates the skin, and changes in light absorption are measured by a photodiode.
- **Pressure Pulse:** Each cardiac cycle pumps blood to the periphery, distending the arteries and arterioles in the subcutaneous tissue.
- **Detection:** The volume change is detected, and each cardiac cycle appears as a peak on the PPG waveform.

PPG can also monitor breathing, hypovolemia, and other circulatory conditions. The waveform shape varies by subject and pulse oximeter attachment. For more information, visit the [Wikipedia page on Photoplethysmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram).
