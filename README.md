# Uses & Concept (Photoplethysmogram)
A photoplethysmogram (PPG) is an optically obtained plethysmogram that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue.
A PPG is often obtained by using a pulse oximeter which illuminates the skin and measures changes in light absorption.
A conventional pulse oximeter monitors the perfusion of blood to the dermis and subcutaneous tissue of the skin. With each cardiac cycle the heart pumps blood to the periphery. 
Even though this pressure pulse is somewhat damped by the time it reaches the skin, it is enough to distend the arteries and arterioles in the subcutaneous tissue. 
If the pulse oximeter is attached without compressing the skin, a pressure pulse can also be seen from the venous plexus, as a small secondary peak.

The change in volume caused by the pressure pulse is detected by illuminating the skin with the light from a light-emitting diode (LED) and then measuring the amount 
of light either transmitted or reflected to a photodiode. Each cardiac cycle appears as a peak, as seen in the figure. 
Because blood flow to the skin can be modulated by multiple other physiological systems, the PPG can also be used to monitor breathing, hypovolemia, 
and other circulatory conditions.Additionally, the shape of the PPG waveform differs from subject to subject, and varies with the location and manner 
in which the pulse oximeter is attached. Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram
